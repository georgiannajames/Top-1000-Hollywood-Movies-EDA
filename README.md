## Summary

Within this repo, I perform an exploratory data analysis of the top 1000 highest grossing movies in Hollywood. 

I clean the data and conduct a summary EDA of the entire dataset to capture overall trends in the Rmd file "hollywood_movies_EDA".


## Data

The analysis is performed entirely using the Highest Holywood Grossing Movies.csv dataset found in the data folder within this repo. 

I sourced this data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sanjeetsinghnaik/top-1000-highest-grossing-movies?select=Highest+Holywood+Grossing+Movies.csv), where you can find a breif description. 


## For Reproducing

For those wishing to reproduce this analysis, simply run the rmd and knit it.
